# 16-bit-Computer-Processor
This is a project i did to get a better understanding of how a Processor works, you must open the file on a open source program called logisim(http://www.cburch.com/logisim/) i also created a simple python script that works as a assembler for the processor, wrote a simple program for anyone to test it for finding fibonacci numbers, there is also a assembled version of the fibonacci program called "16-bitProcessor.txt" you can just upload this text file in the RAM on the 16-bit computer by right clicking "edit ram contents", to run the program if you dont want to use the python script.
